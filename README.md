# Wine Atlas:

https://wine-atlas.herokuapp.com/wines/home/

* This is a working full-stack application using Node.js Mongoose, Express and EJS.
* The file structure of MVC Models Views and Controller was also used to build this app.
* Bcrypt was used for password encryption
* There are 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.
* The app is available on Heroku


## Other goals achieved:

### Two APIs were used:

* Google Maps: The Wine Atlas would not be complete with out a Map. Google had very good documentation about their API.

* Snooth Wine API: It was helpful to have a large database of wines to sort through and display different data points on each wine.

### Styling
Bootstrap, bootsnipp.com, and w3schools.com/howto/ had nice template like features for logins, buttons, dropdowns, and responsive navigation bars.

### Images are from:

* Personal photos were also used.
