# Wine_Atlas

Wine Atlas:

https://wine-atlas.herokuapp.com/wines/home/

-This is a working full-stack application using Node.js Mongoose, Express and EJS. -The file structure of MVC Models Views and Controller was also used to build this app.
-Bcrypt was used for password encryption
-There are 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.
-The app is available on Heroku


Other goals achieved:

Two APIs were used:

Google Maps:
The Wine Atlas would not be complete with out a Map. Google had very good documentation about their API.

Snooth Wine API:
It was helpful to have a large database of wines to sort through and display different data points on each wine.

Bootstrap, bootsnipp.com, and w3schools.com/howto/ had nice template like features for logins, buttons, dropdowns, and responsive navigation bars.
